# coincount
Coin Count is a Javascript/HTML application to help you keep track of your cryptocurrency transactions and what your wallets are worth. Coin Count pulls data about cryptocurrencies from Coin Market Cap, which updates prices every five minutes.

Coin Count saves your data in local web storage. This means your data will be saved indefinitely, but is only available in the browser in which you saved it. It will be deleted if you clear your browser data.

If you want to run the application locally or from a flash drive, you can download the files from GitLab. Just open the .html file in a browser.

A live version of the application is running at https://victoriaroan.github.io/coincount/.
